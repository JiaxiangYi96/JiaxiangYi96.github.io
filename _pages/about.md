I am **Jiaxiang Yi**, a Ph.D. candidate at the  [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/mechanical-engineering), [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/).  

My research focuses on developing advanced **[uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification)** and **[multi-fidelity modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifidelity_modeling)** methods for **[machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)** models.  I apply these methods to problems in **[computational mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mechanics)**, particularly in the **design and characterization of innovative composites made from recycled polymers**. Before joining TU Delft, I earned both my **Bachelorâ€™s** and **Masterâ€™s degrees** from  
[Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/) in China.  During my Masterâ€™s program, my research centered on developing **active-learning surrogate models** for reliability analysis and optimization in engineering design.


## ðŸŽ¯ Research Vision

My long-term goal is to develop **trustworthy and interpretable** machine learning models that feature **principled uncertainty quantification and disentanglement**.  Building upon theoretically founded uncertainty quantification approaches, I aim to advance my research to address real-world problems in engineering and science â€” including, but not limited to, the *autonomous and reliable design* of complex materials ranging from **recycled polymers** to **high-performance composites**.
